## Stock News Analyzer

## Overview

This project builds a Stock News Analysis system using LangGraph. It takes a company name or stock ticker as input, retrieves the latest news using the Tavily API, processes the unstructured text using LLM reasoning, and outputs a structured summary.

## Reason for Picking up This Project
